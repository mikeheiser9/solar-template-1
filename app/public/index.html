Using your ZIP code, you too can check which solar incentives are offered in your area. This tool also helps you calculate your savings by entering your utility provider and the average amount you pay for power. Homeowners are saving up to 50% on their power bills yearly in many cases.</p>

Moreover, homeowners that qualify for <a class="inner-links" href="https://vivintsolaroffers.com/?pid=41927&subid=100001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this new program</a> no longer have to buy solar panels anyway.<br><br>Homeowners can now drastically reduce their power bills without needing to deal with the upfront costs of installing solar panels, all thanks to rebates being as high as they are now. Of course, that wasn’t always the case; solar companies actually used to lose money if they were to rent or lease solar panels. Now, on the other hand, one of the nation’s largest solar power providers claim to be signing up a new solar panel customer every 5 minutes because of these incentivized programs.</p>

The best part about determining your potential savings is that there is absolutely no obligation to do anything until you realize the savings that are on their way to you.<br><br>Right now, we are experiencing some of the highest rebates, tax credits, and other incentives we have seen in years. What people do not know though, is that many of these incentives will expire this year. In some installations, customers are saving up to $14,000 on the setup of a whole-home solar panel system. Everyone could use an extra $14,000 in their pockets and lower power bills, right?</p>
